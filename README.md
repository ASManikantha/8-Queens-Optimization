# 8-Queens Optimization

This repository contains implementations of two optimization algorithms for solving the classic 8-Queens problem: Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm. The goal of the 8-Queens problem is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.

## Project Structure

- `simulated_annealing.py`: Contains the implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm.
- `genetic_algorithm.py`: Contains the implementation of the Genetic Algorithm.
- `run_examples.py`: Provides an example script to run both algorithms and compare results.
